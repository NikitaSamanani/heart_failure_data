Exploratory Data Analysis for Heart Failure

This analysis aims to identify key clinical factors predictive of mortality outcome in heart failure (HF) patients. The heart failure dataset contains 299 patient records with 13 clinical variables. It also has a binary target variable indicating whether a death event occurred. The data was preprocessed by checking for null values, which were not present. The irrelevant time variable was dropped as it held no significance for the study, while the binary outcome variable was converted to a numeric format for analysis. The remaining variables were retained for exploratory analysis and modeling aimed at identifying factors predictive of mortality outcomes.

The data exploration of the datasets was done using the RStudio. Various packages were employed during the data exploration process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. The package mainly used included SmartEDA. SmartEDA package is primarily used for exploratory data analysis, and the package has an advantage over other packages as it automates the process by differentiating the numerical and categorical variables. I used descriptive statistics, line graphs, and boxplots to visualize the data for better understanding. I used line graphs for visualizing the numerical variables and boxplots to visualize the categorical variables. Line graphs showed skewness of the variables, and boxplots showed the outliers in the variables. Quantile-Quantile plot (QQ plot) was used to understand the normality of the variables. Most of the variables were normally distributed.
Statistical analysis of the HF dataset was done using the RStudio. To understand which variables are having a relationship with the target variable, I performed a Spearman correlation and plotted the correlation heatmap. To better understand and confirm the relationships between the variables and the outcome, I also performed a Wilcoxon rank test. One of the study's objectives was to rank the significant features of the outcome variable and so I performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to rank the variables according to their importance with the outcome variable.

I made the predictive models using logistic regression to predict the clinical outcomes of HF. Logistic regression was well-suited given the binary nature of the target variable - whether a patient experienced a death event or not. After preprocessing steps, I split the data into training and test sets using 70% of records for model building. Next, I used the glm() function in R to fit a logistic regression model to the training set, specifying a binomial distribution and logit link as is standard for binary classification problems. The model included important predictors identified through preliminary analysis. Once fitted, I made predictions on the held-out test data using the model. To evaluate performance, I computed the ROC curve based on comparing the predicted probabilities to the true outcomes. This allowed me to visualize how well the model separated classes across various probability thresholds. In summary, logistic regression provided a reasonable baseline for this binary prediction task, demonstrating my proficiency in applying a foundational algorithm as part of the supervised learning workflow.
